Day26
DaisyUI, Tailwind, and the start of our boring but necessary Todo App that will grow to help us learn databases and security!

HOMEWORK:
- a Svelte app with an Express backend, jsut like the previous homework (Videogames app), but for a TODO list using DaisyUI/Tailwind.


You should have:
- A good looking form that POSTS data to the backend, saved in a file for now.
- A good looking list that GETS data from the backiend, and displays the todo lists.
